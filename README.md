### Setup your own League Page
*If you've never touched a line of code, use the [Training Wheels Guide](./TRAINING_WHEELS.md) instead*
- Fork this repo
- Go to `/src/lib/utils/leagueInfo.js` and replace `your_league_id` (line 2) and `your_league_name` (line 3) with your Sleeper league ID and league name. (Optionally, also fill out the dues, and dynasty fields):
![league ID instructions](https://storage.googleapis.com/nfl-player-data/league_id_instructions.png)
- Write your homepage text (league intro/bio) `/src/lib/utils/leagueInfo.js` (lines 9-14)
![homepage text](https://storage.googleapis.com/nfl-player-data/homepage_text.png)
- Next, fill out and uncomment (delete the `// ` at the beginning of each line) the managers' object (lines 27 - 92), also located in `/src/lib/utils/leagueInfo.js`, there should be one object for each manager. The structure may change in the future (it has already ðŸ˜…). The source of truth is down at the bottom, lines 104-126 (for assistance, consult the [Training Wheels guide](https://github.com/nmelhado/league-page/blob/master/TRAINING_WHEELS.md#ii-adding-managers-and-changing-the-homepage-text)).
![manager object](https://storage.googleapis.com/nfl-player-data/managersObj.png)

- Add corresponding images for managers to the `/static/managers/` directory and make the sure the name matches with what was provided above
- If you run into trouble adding managers, reference the [Training Wheels' Manager section](https://github.com/nmelhado/league-page/blob/master/TRAINING_WHEELS.md#ii-adding-managers-and-changing-the-homepage-text)
- Add blog capabilities with [contenful](https://contentful.com/)

    ![content model](https://storage.googleapis.com/nfl-player-data/contentModel.jpg)

        - Use sleeper your sleeper username for the author field when creating posts
    - Create a Content Management API key
    - For local development add a `.env` file to the root of your project and add the following variables
        - `VITE_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the corresponding value obtained from contenful
        - `VITE_CONTENTFUL_SPACE` with your space ID, obtained from contenful
    - Create a Content Delivery / Preview API key
    - For local development add the following variable to your `.env` file

    - To add the variables for production, go to your project settings and add the corresponding keys (using the same names as above) to the environment variables section
