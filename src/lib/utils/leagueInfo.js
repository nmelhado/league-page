  <p>Founded in 2006, the V3 fantasy football league began as a small group of friends based in Valrico, FL. Now, the league consists of 12 managers based all over the country. These 12 managers go head-to-head every season in search of the elusive title, while trying to avoid the ever-humiliating JOMRAD.</p>
  <p>With the transition to a keeper league in 2021, the league has never been more competitive.</p>
  <p>In astounding commitment to building a successful franchise, many of the managers have begun to have kids and groom the next generation of managers to take over their teams. The mini managers are being heavily indoctrinated into the fantasy lifestyle and will be expected to take an active role as soon as they can succesfully type out a coherent trade offer.</p>
  <p>In contrast to the addition of the mini managers, some managers have also left but, despite that, the league has only gotten stronger. With more passionate managers, the competition has become more intense and more difficult each year.</p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious texts to the rest of the league for the next year, the champion manager also walks away with $$$ and the last place manager gets ownership of our beloved Raggedy Anne doll which must be displayed proudly in their house for all visitors to see.</p>
